$\mathcal{J}\ell(s) = \Delta^2 s\ell + \hat R(s\ell)\,\Delta s\ell$

applied to three trajectory classes through each model's fitted Phase-3 Riemannian manifold (intrinsic dim n=8, length L=32, 8 trajectories per class).

## Per-model SHF mean penalty (lower = more geodesic)

## Per-residual cost (training-time gradient implied)

## Kinetic vs curvature decomposition (mean per node)

$\mathcal{J}\ell = \Delta^2 s\ell + \hat R(s\ell)\,\Delta s\ell$ --- we report the squared magnitudes of the two summands separately so the dominant component is visible.

| Model | class | kinetic mean $\|\Delta^2 s\|^2$ | curvature mean $\|\hat R\Delta s\|^2$ | kin/curv |

## Interpretation

- The floor is what a training-time minimiser of $L_{SHF}$ would converge toward; the residual at the floor is the finite-difference truncation error of the discrete Jacobi residual on this manifold.
- The conformant value is what an untrained network with Phase-3-fitted activations already achieves; the gap to the floor is the headroom that training with $L_{SHF}$ could exploit.
- The off-manifold value bounds the penalty from above and indicates the dynamic range over which $\lambda$ should be tuned.
- The kinetic / curvature ratio quantifies how much of the Bellman residual actually carries curvature signal. On the Phase-3 manifolds we have access to the kinetic $\Delta^2$ term dominates by many orders of magnitude (consistent with the curvature-warp negative result, FIVE\_FINDINGS §5: these manifolds are nearly flat). Practical implication: a training-time SHF schedule must either (a) operate on a manifold of demonstrably non-zero curvature, or (b) reduce to ordinary smoothness regularisation (kinetic-only) on current network outputs.

Implication for paper-D §HJB-Regularised Joint Training: the loss term is empirically tractable (sub-second compute for n=8 intrinsic, L=32 layers), the dynamic range (off/floor ratio) determines a meaningful $\lambda$ schedule, and per-token training cost is $O(n^5)$ in intrinsic dim --- affordable when the runtime caches the Riemann tensor at sample points (which it already does for the Jacobi propagator). However the empirical kinetic/curvature ratio shows that on the manifolds currently exported from frozen pretrained networks the curvature contribution to $L_{SHF}$ is negligible; the loss in its current form would act primarily as a second-difference smoothness penalty on block summaries.
